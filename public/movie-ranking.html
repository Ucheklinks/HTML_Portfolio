<h1>The best movies of all time according to Uche </h1>

<h2>Here are my top 3</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Matrix:</h3>
<p>This movie was pure art. The solid story line can compete with any movie story line today</p>
<h3>Gladiator:</h3>
<p>This is one of Russell crowe's best ever movies. This will move you to tears. Has everything from love, to drama, to shock value to betrayal.</p>
<h3>300:</h3>
<p>No other explanation other than Gerrard Butler killed this! watch to find out for yourself! One of my favourite statements in the movie by gerrard Butler (King Leonidas in the movie) was:
<p>"You bring the heads of slain kings to my city steps,<br />
You insult my queen!<br/>
You threaten my people with slavery and death!<br />
Oh! You should have chosen your words carefully persian, we'll see if I do the same.!"<br />
